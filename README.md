# Elemental Documentation

The Elemental documentation is a collection of guides and tutorials to help you get started with Elemental. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to open an issue on the [Elemental GitHub repository](https://github.com/elcengine/elemental/issues).

### Installation

```
$ bun install
```

### Local Development

```
$ bun start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ bun run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Deployment is done automatically by GitHub Actions. The `gh-pages` branch is used to host the website.
