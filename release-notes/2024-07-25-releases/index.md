This is where you can find the latest updates to Elemental. We will be updating this page with every new release.

## 1.1.0

### New Features

- **Filter Query Plugin**: Middleware which allows you to transform a specially crafted RESTful query into a MongoDB query. This middleware is extremely useful when building RESTful APIs with Elemental.

- **Struct Validator Plugin**: Middleware which allows you to validate a struct based on the tags defined in the struct. These validations directly operate on the database layer.

## 1.0.0


- **Initial Release**: This is the first release of Elemental. It includes all core features and plugins that are essential for building RESTful APIs with Go which are backed by MongoDB.
