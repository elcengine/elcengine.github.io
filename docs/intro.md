# Introduction

Elemental is an **Object Document Mapper (ODM)** for **Golang and MongoDB**. It is designed to address your pain points when working with the plain MongoDB Go driver.

Elemental is heavily inspired by the popular **Mongoose** library for **Node.js**. It provides a simple and intuitive way to work with MongoDB in Go while still giving you the flexibility to work with the raw MongoDB driver when needed.

With Elemental, you can:

- **Define an intuitive Schema and from it, a Model** for your MongoDB documents.

- **Define and run complex queries** using the Querybuilder API.

- **Inject middleware and utilize plugins** to extend the functionality of your models.

- **Interact with multiple data sources** with ease.

- **And so much more!**

For a full list of features, have a good look though the side panel. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to open an issue on the **[Elemental GitHub repository](https://github.com/elcengine/elemental/issues)**.
