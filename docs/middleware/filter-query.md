# Filter Query

The filter query is a special type of middleware which allows you to transform a specially crafted RESTful query into a MongoDB query. This middleware is extremely useful when building RESTful APIs with Elemental.

For detailed information on how to use the filter query middleware, refer to it under the **[plugin section](/docs/plugins/filter-query)**.
